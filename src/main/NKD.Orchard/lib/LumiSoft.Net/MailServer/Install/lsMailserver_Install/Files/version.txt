                Currently 'Public Folders' is mapped to account 'publicfolders'.
                To try this feature just make account 'publicfolders' connect to this account with some IMAP client 
                what support ACL. Just make folders and apply acl to shared folders.
                Example:   
                        publicfolders/Documents
                        publicfolders/Archive

                   This will be visible to public as:
                        Public Folders/Documents  -> publicfolders/Documents

                To try this feature just connect with some IMAP client 
                what support ACL. Just apply acl to shared folders.
                Example:
                        (Your local account: myAccount)
                        Inbox
                        MyShared (ACL access specified)

                   This will be visible to public as:
                        Shared Folders/myAccount/MyShared  -> MyShared
        *) New: Partial IMAP SEARCH command (11.03.2005)
                Currently won't support keyword NOT,OR and parentized () search.
                If somebody has good idea how to implement parentized and nested seraches, please let me know.


        (NOTE: SQL users update stored procedures and you need to create new table!!! )
                Create table lsIMAP_ACL(        
                        Folder        nvarchar(500) Default (''),
                        [User]        nvarchar(100) Default (''),
                        [Permissions] nvarchar(20)  Default ('')
                )

        *) Fix: POP3 remote accounts service may stopped if any invalid settings secified for user POP3 remote server.
        *) Fix: IMAP folder related commands didn't support % (sibling folders retrieving), retuned all folders instead.
        *) Fix: POP3 TOP command didn't return more than 150 lines if requested so.
        *) New: Allow specify SMTP smart host username and password.
        *) Fix: SMTP relay didn't report host name specified in SMTP settings for Retry messages sending.
        *) New: Support partial message fetching BODY[]<0.222> and BODY.PEEK[]<0.222> (in FETCH command). (28.11.2004)
        *) Fix: Block messages with invalid chars like LF(must be CRLF, but only LF not allowed),CR(without LF),char(0).
                Most of such messages are spam and causes mail client problems (can't download/delete message from server).  (05.12.2004)
        *) New: Add POP3 CAPA command (rfc 2449). (06.12.2004)

        *) New: Password hack dedector. Server allows 20 bad logins for IP+UserName in 5 minutes, after that it just skips
                password check and returns that login failed. Block will be released after 5 minutes.
        *) Fix: IMAP FETCH won't allow syntax body[header.fields (from)], requires (body[header.fields (from)]).
                This may happen only if  body[header.fields (from)] is only parameter for fetch.
        *) Fix: (For MSSQL API only) Domain deletion deleted all security entries.
        *) Fix: UserRule * pattern didn't worked when comapred header field was empty.
        *) Fix: If sender address is similar "sender@" (no domain specified) and destination sender was undeliverable, 
                server started endless undelivery warning loop.
        *) Fix: SMTP_Client (relay), some mailservers won't send '221 closing connection', just skip cheking this.
                This caused multiple messages duplication to destination recipient and reported local user that message was
                undeliverable.Duplication lasted while message undelivered time was reached.
        *) Fix: If dns server not available, don't consider message as undelivered, wait undelivery time. 
        *) New: DNSBL spam filtering. Just add this filter(ls_DNSBL_Filter.exe) in mailserver manager UI and configure running 
                ls_DNSBL_Filter.exe. NOTE: some default filters are already configured.
