<p class="posttitle">	Global Message Rules</p>
<p class="post">Global Message Rules helps you to filter and manage incoming and 
outgoing messages before they delivered to users mailbox or sent-out, by applying server 
based rules that match a specific set of expressions. When a specified rule is 
matched the associated actions will be executed in the order specified.<br>
<blockquote>In order to better understand the message flow in the Lumi Mailserver 
	you can refer to
	<a href="#" onclick="javascript:openImage('images/MessageFlow.png');">Message Flow diagram</a>. 
<br>In short, when a message arrives or sent out from or to your server it will pass 
through the <a href="#">Routing</a> which will resolve the actual destination of the message and 
	then will be passed to Global Message Rules. Once the message is filtered in 
Global Message Rules it will be passed to User Message Rules (if the message is 
not deleted or dropped in Global Message Rules), in which it will be filtered 
and delivered to User's mailbox (again if the message is not deleted or dropped 
in User Message Rules). </blockquote>
<p class="post">You can think of Global Message Rules as the virtual-domain-wide rules engine that 
applies to all users and all incoming and outgoing messages.<br>
The Administrator can create Global Message Rules from the MailServerManager Interface;<br> 
<i>MailServer &gt; MailStore &gt; Rules &gt; Message Rules &gt; Global</i></p>
<p class="posttitle">Create a new Global Message Rule</p>
<p class="post">Click the New button from the toolbar to bring Add/Edit Global 
Message dialog. Lets look at the fields in this dialog;<br><font color="#000080">
<strong>Description field</strong></font><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a required field where you will 
give a descriptive name for your new rule.<br><font color="#000080"><strong>Match Expression</strong></font><strong>:&nbsp;</strong> 
Our expression (matching expression) for our new 
rule. Refer to <a href="GRules-Expression.htm">Match Expression</a> for details.<br><font color="#000080">
<strong>Check button:</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clicking this button will check the validation of our Match Expression.<br>
<font color="#000080"><strong>Actions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></font><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The type of actions to run when 
Match Expression is met. Refer to <a href="GRules-Actions.htm">Actions</a> for 
details.<br><font color="#000080"><strong>Enabled:</strong></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
If we uncheck this field our Rule will be simply disabled and checking will be 
enable.<br><strong>C</strong><font color="#000080"><strong>heck Next Rule</strong>:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Dropdown that defines the condition to check the next Rule in Global Message 
Rules<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#000080">Always</font>: Always run the next rule once the current 
rule is finished.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#000080">If this Rule Match</font>: 
Run the next rule only-if this Rule's expression is matched (the result is true)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font color="#000080">If this Rule does not Match</font>: Run the next rule 
only-if this Rules' expression not matched (the result is false</p>
<p class="post">Once you define your new rule click OK to save and return to 
Global Message Rules pane. Pay attention to Up and Down buttons on the right. 
This two buttons help us to set the order of our rules, when we have more than 
one rule defined. When you want to change the order of execution for your rules, 
instead of removing and re-creating the rules you will simply change its order 
by using these two buttons. The top-most rule will be the first rule that will 
run. You can also double-click on any rule to bring the Edit Rule dialog besides 
clicking Edit button from toolbar.&nbsp;If you see your rule name having a 
strikethrough that means it is disabled by the admin, Edit the Rule and check 
Enabled field to enable it back.</p>
<p class="post">In order to utilize the functionality of Global Message Rules, 
pay special attention to the type of <a href="GRules-Expression.htm">Match 
Expression</a> and <a href="GRules-Actions.htm">Actions</a> which contains 
examples and provide inside to available scenarios. <br>
