/* Bind Custom Theme:Metro */


*** SEARCH NOTICE ***

The Metro theme uses a custom Search Form,
so the Search Feature should be enabled or the search box won't work.

The Search feature can be installed by going to:
Orchard > Gallery > Modules

and then enabled:
Orchard > Settings > Features


*** ZONES **

The theme uses the same 19 Zones as "TheThemeMachine" Theme.

Regards
Bind Team
